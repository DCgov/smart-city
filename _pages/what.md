title: What is a Smart City Project?
---

The global community is gearing up for the next generation Internet of Things (IoT) technology which will dramatically increase the number of connected devices in the District. These sensors will enable a more accurate representation of our environment through real-time data collection, and thus, significantly increasing autonomy and efficiency.

The Smart City proof of concept projects while focused on delivering more immediate priorities in areas of Economic Development, Transportation, Energy, Environment and Urban Planning, indirectly influences long-term city planning and operations.

Planning and management: public safety, governemt and agency administration, city planning and operations, and building management. Infrastructure: energy and environment, water, and transportation. Citizen focused: education healthcare, and social programs." />

The [featured projects](featured.html) show examples of Smart City projects in progress across various parts of the District and led by various District agencies.

While the District is working on a collective and collaborative definition of what a Smart DC should be, characteristics of a Smart City include the following elements:
* Led or Sponsored by a District agency
* Real-time data collection through network of sensors
* Heat map or dashboard visualizing datasets

**The OCTO Smart City Inventory aims to develop a complete picture, across all eight wards, of smart city-aligned projects, partner organizations, and opportunities**

The [Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO)](http://octo.dc.gov/) is leading an interagency effort to explore how “smart city” technology can be used in the District. [Smart city technology]() leverages intelligent city infrastructure, including connected devices, sensors, and data analytics, to improve quality of life for residents, enhance economic growth, and address city challenges.

This effort reflects a partnership between city agencies and other key District stakeholders including the federal government, universities, business improvement districts (BIDs), the tech community, and others interested in working together to make a smarter DC.

### We want to hear from you

Are you or your organization interested in or currently working on smart city topics? Tell us about your projects or ideas by completing [our questionnaire](/questionnaire.html). We’ll add relevant projects to our [project inventory](/inventory.html), and use this knowledge to identify new opportunities for partnership and investment.

This website and project inventory is a first step in a larger initiative that will evolve and expand over time. If you have ideas for what OCTO or the District government could be doing or want to contribute to these efforts, please get in touch with us at [smarterdc@dc.gov](mailto:smarterdc@dc.gov).

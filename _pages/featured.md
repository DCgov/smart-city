[**ParkDC**](http://ddot.dc.gov/page/parkdc)

ParkDC is an initiative by the District Department of Transportation (DDOT) to manage and regulate the District’s curbside and parking assets.
Leveraging the current Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)-funded parkDC “smart parking” pilot, additional roadside equipment (RSE) will be installed to monitor parking space occupancy, allowing travelers or vehicles to identify blocks with available spaces and DDOT to adjust parking prices so demand is better reflected. Expanded RSE for loading zones will enable enforcement and monitoring of freight parking to reduce double parking and communicate to users. This will enhance the parking experience in the central business district and provide seamless integration with the rest of the RSE.
